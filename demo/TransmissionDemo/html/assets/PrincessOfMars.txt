I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until after I have passed
over for eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so
I do not purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and held up as a colossal
liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate. Possibly the
suggestions which I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down in this chronicle will
aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries of our sister planet; mysteries to you, but no
longer mysteries to me.

A Princess of Mars, Edgar Rice Burroughs
